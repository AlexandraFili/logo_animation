 Animation of the Tranquil Services logo
Approach:
The final centres of the rings make a triangle. 
To space the rings at the same equal distance from each other 
at the points of aproximately an equilateral triangle. 
We need to find the x and y distance offset from each other.
This Pythagorus' Theorum for triangles is used to obtain the offset where x==y
Once these positions are found, the offsets are further adjusted manually to obtain the final required position.
Animation is achieved by setting a starting position displaced from the final position,and incrementally moving the rings into the final position. Please check it out here https://alexandrafili.github.io/logo_animation/
